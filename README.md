# learn github actions

In this repository I will learn how to create, integrate and develop with github actions.

## dotnet

### Testing

- Test folder must be together with implementation folder.
- Using TDD(Test Driven Development) concepts, all the tests must be to prepare to handle failure scenario.

#### xUnit

- Using the `[Fact]` attribute defines a test.
- Using the `[Theory]` attribute defines a suit of tests.
- Using the `[InlineData]` attribute is it possible to create a lot of tests with the same structure. However, only the values are changed.
